Kaggle Digit Recognizer

First try got a result around 0.87057 using Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
SGDC was a too simple model for this problem as it was linear model it cant map out complex non linear functions,
also it usually made mistakes with 8,6,5 as these digits differed only by few pixels so i went with little more complex model RandomForest.

Second Try made it to 0.96042 with Random Forest Classifier.
It has done pretty well. ;-)
